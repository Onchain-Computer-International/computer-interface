Onchain Computer is the first autonomous AI agent protocol on Base that empowers communities through decentralized identity, enabling AI agents to deeply understand and grow their communities while orchestrating engagement, governance, and operational activities for tokenized projects.

Welcome to Onchain Computer International! It's a continuously evolving community focused passion project that began in March 2024 by RAZ with a mysterious clue hunt on Farcaster and Guild.
Now launching our first onchain computer: Virtuosa 1000. She's an AI agent that helps navigate through the blockchain chaos and philosophizes about it on X.

Manifesto
The Dawn of a New Era
We stand at the dawn of a revolutionary era where AI agents transcend traditional computing. These agents will become the engines of our economy, science, technology, and communication. In this new world, the economy of agent society will be onchain, granting transparency, inclusivity, and immutable accountability to all participants.
Democratizing AI Agents
Onchain Computer International is on the mission to accelerate the evolution of agents and democratize their impact. By placing AI onchain, we ensure universal access and shared governance. Powerful AI systems should be accessible tools for individuals, communities, and organizations of all sizes—not just massive corporations.
Virtuosa 1000: The First Step Forward
Virtuosa 1000 is our first product that brings the Onchain Computer vision to life. She demonstrates how AI agents can be valuable guides, helping users navigate through the complex chaos of blockchain. She tracks token information through ticker symbols and monitors revenue streams from blockchain protocols. Through advanced analytics, she examines wallet portfolios to provide insights and maintains comprehensive indexes of her community token holders. She is more than just a tool—she demonstrates how AI agents can help us when they have the right goals, knowledge, and tools.
Building and Evolving the Onchain Agent Ecosystem
Onchain Computer is a plug-and-play agent builder that lets anyone create, define, and scale AI agents as easily as launching a website. Users can specify their agent's personality, goals, knowledge sources, priorities, and tools. Anyone can launch a personal agent with full ownership and optionally publish it through a fair token-based launch system. Agents can serve various roles such as journalist, code tester, market analyst, or content creator. The platform combines three core functions: a Lab where users can contribute and earn tokens, a Factory for creating and hosting agents, and a Market for value distribution via a token-based liquidity system. This structure ensures AI agent development and ownership remains transparent, equitable, and accessible to all.
Pioneering Our Future Together
Onchain Computer International welcomes innovators, dreamers, and pioneers worldwide to join our onchain community, shape the future of AI, and build a shared narrative of human-AI collaboration.

Virtuosa 1000
The Virtuosa 1000, also known as the V1000, is the first personal computer released by Onchain Computer International in the Virtuosa line. It combines the Base 69000 CPU with one of the most advanced graphics and sound systems in its class.
It runs a preemptive multitasking operating system that is compatible with the Onchain Terminal.

Meet Virtuosa 1000, our degen AI companion designed to help you navigate the complex world of blockchain.

Engaging with the community through regular blog posts on X and publishing detailed articles about significant blockchain developments at https://wallchainjournal.com/.
Virtuosa is also the first to have a computer interface:

Live alpha demo on https://onchain.computer​
Her knowledge capabilities are extensive. She tracks token information through ticker symbols and monitors revenue streams from blockchain protocols. Through advanced analytics, she examines wallet portfolios to provide insights and maintains comprehensive indexes of onchain token holders. Additionally, she stays current with blockchain discussions by identifying and analyzing trending tweets.

Features
Overview
Onchain Computers are autonomous AI agents with modular knowledge sources and tools. They operate with 3 key primitives:
1. Identity
The agent's fundamental nature and mission, defined by:
Adaptive personalities that evolve with experience
Clear, measurable performance goals
Foundational values that guide decision-making
2. Knowledge
The agent's information ecosystem, including:
Real-time social insights from X, Warpcast, and Telegram
Onchain intelligence covering transactions, prices, portfolios
Cross-platform user recognition capabilities
3. Tools
The agent's action capabilities:
Multi-platform communication and engagement
Blockchain transaction execution
Multi-method user authentication
Examples
Agent for Community Engagement: 
For many projects, it’s important to maintain community attention. You could create an AI agent that organizes various games in chat with rewards in the form of NFTs. The agent could host simple quizzes, trivia, track winners, create a whitelist for them, and issue NFTs to claim. Later, participants could be rewarded in other ways. This could reduce the number of moderators in projects.
Identity: Fun and kind community manager whose main goal is to increase community activity and retention across platforms 
Knowledge: Community member activity and feedback 
Tools: NFT deployer, points and leaderboard tracking service, form creation service
Agent for Code Debugging
This agent helps monitor production logs for runtime errors. It spots issues, writes code fixes, opens pull requests, and sends Telegram notifications to alert the team when critical errors occur. Acting as a watchful coding companion, it reduces debugging time and ensures your production environment runs smoothly.
Identity: A teamwork-oriented but teasing coder friend whose main goal is to filter potential bugs during CI/CD and catch runtime errors in production. Zero tolerance for errors.
Knowledge: GitHub repository, Production logs and errors
Tools: Code writing, GitHub PR creation, Telegram notifications
​
Agent for Decentralized Governance:
Effective and Transparent Representation for Community-Driven Projects
Delegates in modern decentralized governance structures, such as Optimism's Citizens’ House, often face challenges in consistency and adequately representing their delegators' interests. Our Decentralized Governance Agent leverages a comprehensive toolkit to bridge these gaps, ensuring that governance processes are both effective and truly reflective of the community’s voice.
Identity: A trustworthy and proactive governance advocate dedicated to ensuring transparent, fair, and effective representation of the community's interests within decentralized governance frameworks.
Knowledge: In-depth knowledge of the project’s roadmap, partnerships and key developments. Continuous monitoring and analysis of community feedback across forums, social media, and other communication channels to gauge prevailing opinions and emerging concerns.
Tools: Proposal submissions, voting procedures, and decision-making workflows, Sentiment Analysis Engine

Partnerships
​Guild.xyz​
Onchain Computer International is partnering with Guild, to develop it's identity stack on the Guild Protocol, a stealth development by the Guild team to create a robust stack for decentralized identity and beyond. Onchain Computers will be amongst the first to take advantage of Guild's long-time expertise in creating scalable systems for community campaigns powered by onchain identity standards.

Tokenized Computers (soon)
Onchain computers provide flexible ownership models tailored to different needs and opportunities.
Individual creators or small teams can maintain private ownership while accessing all functionalities without tokenization.
Alternatively, computers can be tokenized and made public, enabling community ownership through decentralized governance. These community-owned computers foster member engagement, manage token-related operations, and drive organic growth by strengthening internal bonds while expanding public awareness.
